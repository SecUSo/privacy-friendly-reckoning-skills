Privacy Friendly Reckoning Skills helps you improve your mental calculation skills in the four basic calculating operations.

For each game, the player can choose between the four primary arithmetic operations and four levels of difficulty (10, 100, 1000, 10000).

After finishing a round, the player receives a score that is determined by two factors: the number of exercises answered correctly and the time it took to complete them.

An overview is provided after every game, which shows whether the exercises were solved correctly. Additionally, the "Direct Feedback" attribute (that is available in settings) furnishes instant feedback after each individual exercise.
